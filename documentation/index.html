<h3 id="frequently_asked_questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>Below are some Frequently Asked Questions that may help you in finding a solution to your specific issue.</p>
<h4>1. I have just uploaded the download zip file to WordPress, but it is showing installation error. Why?</h4>
<p>Your download zip file is not the plugin itself. It is a collection of plugin and documentation. It will be required to unzip this folder first. Next look for the folder named <strong>"wp-post-modules-el.zip</strong>". Use this zip folder for uploading the plugin via WordPress. Alternatively, you can download installable plugin file from your CodeCanyon account's downloads section.</p>
<h4>2. How to update the plugin</h4>
<p>Plugin can be updated in two ways:</p>
<p>2.1) <strong>From the WordPress admin</strong>: Navigate to Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins. Deactivate the &quot;WP Post Modules&quot; plugin and delete it. Next, install the latest copy of plugin by browsing the <code>wp-post-modules-el.zip</code> file from your computer.</p>
<p>2.2)<strong> From the FTP or Control Panel</strong>: Log in to your FTP or Control Panel of hosting account and locate the <code>/wp-content/plugins/wp-post-modules-el/</code> folder. Delete this folder and update the latest extracted folder from your computer. This method is safer than the previous one.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> After updating the plugin, clear all browser caches and plugin caches (if using a caching plugin).</p>
